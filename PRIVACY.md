# Privacy Policy — Newsfeed Burner

_Last updated: February 2026_

## Summary

Newsfeed Burner does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data whatsoever.

## What we collect

Nothing. The extension operates entirely within your browser and never sends any data anywhere.

## How it works

- The extension injects CSS into social media pages to hide newsfeeds.
- Your blocking state and procrastination timer are stored locally in your browser using the Chrome `storage` API. This data never leaves your device.
- No analytics, no tracking, no telemetry, no crash reports.

## Third parties

No data is shared with any third party. The extension makes no network requests of its own.
